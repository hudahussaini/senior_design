      "1. Introduction\n",
      "Censoring and endogeneity are common problems in data analysis. For example, income\n",
      "survey data are often censored due to top-coding and many economic variables such as\n",
      "hours worked, wages and expenditure shares are naturally bounded from below by zero.\n",
      "Endogeneity is also an ubiquitous phenomenon both in experimental studies due to partial\n",
      "noncompliance (Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin, 1996), and in observational studies due to si-\n",
      "multaneity (Koopmans and Hood, 1953), measurement error (Frish, 1934), sample selection\n",
      "(Heckman, 1979) or more generally to relevant omitted variables. Censoring and endogene-\n",
      "ity often come together in economic applications. For example, both of them arise in the\n",
      "estimation of Engel curves for alcohol – the relationship between the share of expenditure on\n",
      "alcohol and the household’s budget. For this commodity, a signiﬁcant fraction of households\n",
      "report zero expenditure, and economic theory suggests that the total expenditure and its\n",
      "composition are jointly determined in the consumption decision of the household. Either\n",
      "censoring or endogeneity lead to inconsistency of traditional mean and quantile regression\n",
      "estimators by inducing correlation between regressors and unobservables. We introduce a\n",
      "quantile regression estimator that deals with both problems and name this estimator the\n",
      "censored quantile instrumental variable (CQIV) estimator.\n",
      "Our procedure deals with censoring semiparametrically through the conditional quantile\n",
      "function following Powell (1986). This approach avoids the strong parametric assumptions\n",
      "of traditional Tobit estimators.\n",
      "The key ingredient here is the equivariance property of\n",
      "quantile functions to monotone transformations such as censoring. Powell’s censored quan-\n",
      "tile regression estimator, however, has proven to be diﬃcult to compute.\n",
      "We address this\n",
      "problem using the computationally attractive algorithm of Chernozhukov and Hong (2002).\n",
      "An additional advantage of focusing on the conditional quantile function is that we can cap-\n",
      "ture heterogeneous eﬀects across the distribution by computing CQIV at diﬀerent quantiles\n",
      "(Koenker, 2005). The traditional Tobit framework rules out this heterogeneity by imposing\n",
      "a location shift model.\n",
      "We deal with endogeneity using a control variable approach. The basic idea is to add\n",
      "a variable to the regression such that, once we condition on this variable, regressors and\n",
      "unobservables become independent. This so-called control variable is usually unobservable\n",
      "and needs to be estimated in a ﬁrst stage.\n",
      "Our main contribution here is to allow for\n",
      "semiparametric models with inﬁnite dimensional parameters and nonadditive unobservables,\n",
      "such as quantile regression and distribution regression, to model and estimate the ﬁrst stage\n",
      "and back out the control variable. This part of the analysis constitutes the main theoretical\n",
      "diﬃculty because the ﬁrst stage estimators do not live in spaces with nice entropic properties,\n",
      "unlike, for example, in Andrews (1994) or Newey (1994). To overcome this problem, we\n",
