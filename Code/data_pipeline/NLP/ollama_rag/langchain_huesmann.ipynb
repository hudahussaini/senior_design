      "hostile and instrumental aggression differ. On the biosocial level, low arousability should \n",
      "be a risk factor for instrumental aggression and high arousability a risk factor for hostile \n",
      "aggression, and we reported some evidence of that. At the information processing level in-\n",
      "strumental aggression should be more a function of having encoded a large repertoire of \n",
      "aggressive scripts for solving social problems and of having acquired normative beliefs \n",
      "approving of aggression. Hostile aggression should be more a function of high emotional \n",
      "responsivity and hostile attributional bias. Crick and Dodge (in press) have recently re-\n",
      "ported empirical data that seem to be consistent with these predictions. \n",
      "At the same time the basic social/cognitive processing for all social behavior is the \n",
      "same, and the basic information processing model presented in this paper applies to both \n",
      "kinds of aggression. Similarly, the process of observational learning operates similarly for \n",
      "both types of aggression. One particular biosocial interaction that could be expected to in-\n",

      "enhance the likelihood that previously observed scripts and schemas would be activated. \n",
      "The arousal makes complex cognitive processing less likely. The dysphoric valence of the \n",
      "emotion activates schemas related to hostility, and the arousal narrows memory activation. \n",
      "The result is that observed antisocial, aggressive scripts are more likely to be encoded dur-\n",

      "emotional states. Thus, it is not surprising that high temperatures (Anderson & Anderson, \n",

      "authors' discussion of the meaning of a nonlinear rela- \n",

      "\"in control\" make punishment work, or does it just \n",
      "prevent deleterious consequences? Deater-Deckard and \n",
      "Dodge tend to focus on the issue of whether punishment \n",
      "stimulates externalizing behavior or does nothing. For \n",
      "example, they hypothesize that \"when physical disci- \n",

      "Parents transmit information about what is normative \n",

      "Deater-Deckard and Dodge's most important point, in \n",
      "this regard, is that it is the differences in cognitions \n",

      "not any constitutional or environmental difference. \n",

INTRODUCTION \\n5 \\nAlthough habitual aggressive and violent behaviors seldom develop in children un-\\nless there is a convergence of multiple predisposing and precipitating biosocial and con-\\ntextual factors, there is compelling evidence that early observation of aggression and \\nviolence in the child's environment or in the mass media contributes substantially to the \\ndevelopment of aggressive habits that may persist throughout the life course (Bandura, \\n1986; Berkowitz, 1993; Paik & Comstock, 1994; Eron, Huesmann, Lefkowitz & Walder, \\n1972; Huesmann, 1986; Huesmann & Eron, 1986; Huesmann & Miller, 1994).

In this chapter I provide an \\noverview of an unified cognitive/information-processing model of social behavior within \\nwhich aggression can be understood, I elaborate on the key role that observational learn-\\ning plays in the development of the cognitive/information-processing structures that con-\\ntrol social behavior in general and aggressive behavior in particular; and I discuss the \\nbiosocial processes that seem to be involved in observational learning of these cogni-\\ntive/information-processing structures. \\nIn the context of this chapter, aggressive behavior is any behavior intended to injure \\nor irritate another person (Berkowitz, 1993; Eron et aI., 1972). Excluded from this defini-\\ntion is the \"assertive\" behavior of dynamic sales people and executives that is often called \\n\"aggressive\" by the public.

While some scholars have ar-\\ngued that all aggressive behavior is instrumental in some way, rageful assaults out of an-\\nger are often so different in character from violent acts committed for tangible gain that \\nthe distinction seems valuable. Furthermore, one can often detect individual differences in \\narousal predispositions associated with people who habitually engage in the different \\ntypes of aggression (Baker, Hastings, & Hart, 1984; Craven & Lochman, 1997; Raine, \\nVenables, & Williams, 1990). Nevertheless, an examination of the underlying cognitive \\nprocesses involved (e.g., Dodge & Coie, 1987) has led to a realization that many of the \\nsame mechanisms are involved in both types of aggression.

First, habitual aggressive behavior usu-\\nally emerges early in life, and early aggressive behavior is very predictive of later \\naggressive behavior and even of aggressive behavior of offspring (Farrington, 1982; 1995; \\nHuesmann, Eron, Lefkowitz & Walder, 1984; Loeber & Dishion, 1983; Magnusson, \\nDuner, & Zetterblom, 1975; Olweus, 1979). Process models for aggressive behavior need \\nto explain this continuity over time and across generations. Second, as the title of this \\nbook suggests, severe aggression is most often a product of multiple interacting social and \\nbiological factors (Coie & Dodge, in press) including genetic predispositions (Bouchard, \\n1984; Cloninger & Gottesman, 1987; Mednick, Gabrielli, & Hutchins, 1984; Rushton et'), Document(metadata={'source': '/nfs/turbo/si-acastel/expert_field_project/full_pdfs_by_author/huesmann/978-1-4757-4648-8_5.pdf', 'file_path': '/nfs/turbo/si-acastel/expert_field_project/full_pdfs_by_author/huesmann/978-1-4757-4648-8_5.pdf', 'page': 1, 'total_pages': 20, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat 9.4 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creationDate': \"D:20131227204008+08'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20131227205059+08'00'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='aI., 1986), environment/genetic interactions (Lagerspetz & Lagerspetz, 1971; Lagerspetz \\n& Sandnabba, 1982), CNS trauma and neurophysiological abnormalities (Moyer, 1976; \\nNachson & Denno, 1987; Pontius, 1984), early temperament or attention difficulties (Ka-\\ngan, 1988; Moffitt, 1990), arousal levels (Raine & Jones, 1987; Raine, Venables, & Wil-\\nliams, 1990; in press), hormonal levels (Olweus, Mattsson, Schalling, & Low, 1988), \\nfamily violence (Widom, 1989), cultural perspectives (Staub, 1996), poor parenting (Pat-\\nterson, 1995), inappropriate punishment (Eron, Walder, & Lefkowitz, 1971), environ-\\nmental poverty and stress (Guerra, Huesmann, Tolan, Eron, & VanAcker, 1995), \\npeer-group identification (Patterson, Capaldi, & Bank, 1991), and other factors.

Third, early learning and socialization playa key role in the development of \\nhabitual aggression. From a social cognitive perspective the variety of predisposing fac-\\ntors discussed above may make the emergence of certain specific cognitive routines, \\nscripts, and schemas more likely, but these cognitions are learned through interactions of \\nthe child with the environment (Bandura, 1973; Berkowitz, 1974; Eron, Walder, & \\nLefkowitz, 1971).

However, both hy-\\npothesize a similar core of information processing, both draw heavily on the work of cog-\\nnitive psychologists and information processing theory, and both draw from Bandura's \\n(1977; 1986) earlier formulations of cognitive processing in social learning as well as \\nBerkowitz's (1990) neoassociationist thinking. \\nIn Figure I I present Huesmann's (in press) recent integration of the key elements of\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/nfs/turbo/si-acastel/expert_field_project/full_pdfs_by_author/huesmann/978-1-4757-4648-8_5.pdf', 'file_path': '/nfs/turbo/si-acastel/expert_field_project/full_pdfs_by_author/huesmann/978-1-4757-4648-8_5.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 20, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat 9.4 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creationDate': \"D:20131227204008+08'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20131227205059+08'00'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='these social/cognitive models into an unified information processing model that explains the \\nrole of cognition in aggressive behavior. This model begins with the premise that social be-\\nhavior is controlled to a great extent by cognitive scripts (Abelson, 1981) that are stored in a \\nperson\\'s memory and are used as gl!ides for behavior and social problem solving. A script in-\\ncorporates both procedural and declarative knowledge and suggests what events are to happen \\nin the environment, how the person should behave in response to these events, and what the \\nlikely outcome of those behaviors would be. It is presumed that while scripts are first being \\nestablished they influence the child\\'s behavior through \"controlled\" mental processes \\n(Schneider & Shriffrin, 1977; ShrifTrin & Schneider, 1977), but these processes become \\n\"automatic\" as the child matures.

Hostile Attributional Bias and Observational Learning \\nIt is now well established that aggressive individuals tend to perceive hostility in \\nothers where there is no hostility, i.e. display a hostile attributional bias (Dodge, 1980; \\nDodge & Coie, 1987; Dodge & Frame, 1982; Dodge,Price, Bachorowski, & Newman,\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/nfs/turbo/si-acastel/expert_field_project/full_pdfs_by_author/huesmann/978-1-4757-4648-8_5.pdf', 'file_path': '/nfs/turbo/si-acastel/expert_field_project/full_pdfs_by_author/huesmann/978-1-4757-4648-8_5.pdf', 'page': 7, 'total_pages': 20, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat 9.4 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creationDate': \"D:20131227204008+08'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20131227205059+08'00'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='1990; Graham & Hudley, 1994; Nasby, Hayden & DePaulo, 1979; Slaby & Guerra. 1988; \\nSteinberg & Dodge, 1983). A long history of research on social perception (e.g. see Fiske, \\n1982; Fiske & Taylor. 1991; Schneider, 1991), as well as recent research on aggression, \\nsuggest that this hostile attributional bias is a product of the schemas that an individual \\nhas encoded and activating cues. Dodge and Tomlin (1987) reported evidence that aggres-\\nsive children are relying on their own encoded aggressive self-schemas and stereotypes in \\nmaking intent attributions. Zelli and Huesmann (1993) have found that college students \\nwith greater ingrained persecution beliefs are more likely to perceive hostility when none \\nis there.

There is good reason \\nto think that observational learning plays a major role. A variety of evidence exists to sup-\\nport the conclusion that those who see more violent behavior in real life or in the mass \\nmedia begin to falsely perceive more violence around them than do others.

For example, the \\nscripts retrieved by more aggressive children to solve hypothetical problems tend to incor-\\nporate more physical aggression and manipulation actions (Rubin, Bream & Rose-Kras-\\nnor, 1991; Rubin, Moller, & Emptage, 1987; Waas, 1988).
